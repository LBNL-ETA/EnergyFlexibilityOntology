# How EFOnt can help building energy flexibility simulations

Traditionaly, BEM tools were designed to simulate building energy and thermal performance. As energy flexibility becomes an increasingly important building performance aspect, there are growing needs for simulating energy flexibility using BEM. However, the data dictionaries and input/output specifications of existing BEM tools do not have clear guidance on how to simulate energy flexibility. The barriers are mainly two-folds. Firstly, there is no description of which energy flexibility resources could be simulated using which objects in the BEM tools. Secondly, there is no description of which KPIs can be used to evaluate the energy flexibility, and which BEM sensor, meter, and variables are needed to compute the KPIs.

As a result, energy modelers who want to simulate energy flexibility need to understand which objects to modify in their models, extract the simulation results and compute the KPIs case-by-case, which can be tedious and error-prone. EFOnt can serve as an interface between energy modelers and BEM tools, which maps typical energy flexibility resources and related output variables with BEM objects. Figure 1 shows an example of such mapping.

# Examples

The following two examples will demonstrate how EFOnt could help simulating and quantifying building energy flexibility in more details. Both examples used DOE prototype small office building models with OpenStudio and EnergyPlus. 15 climate zones were considered to show the geographical differences. Table 1 shows the geometry and basic information of the building.

## Example 1 - EF with on-site PV generation and EV-charging
In the first example, we show how EFOnt can help quantify the on-site PV utilization performance using two EF KPIs - Self-Sufficiency and Self-Consumption. As introduced, EFOnt maps energy flexibility resources with BEM objects. 

<b>Figure 2</b> shows the flexibility resources defined in EFOnt and corresponding EnergyPlus objects to model PV generation and EV demand.

<b>Figure 4</b> shows (1) left: the heatmap of the monthly PV Self-Suffciency (SS) in the building at different locations with and without EV charging, and (2) right: how EFOnt can help computing the KPI. It can be seen that with EV charging could benefit the on-site generated PV utilization.
